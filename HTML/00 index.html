      <h2>A little background on Sunday Night...</h2>
        <p>Executive producer Scott Harper founded Sunday Night Entertainment in 2001 following his first independent network commission “Cake Night,” a POV behind-the-scenes at an addiction recovery facility. New projects include Clara’s Big Ride, featuring the Canadian Olympian Clara Hughes. Premiering to over a million viewers in January, it’s one part social issue film on the stigma surrounding mental health, one part epic red movie, and one part love letter to Canada.Subsequently Scott wrote, produced and directed Lost Adventures of Childhood — which explored the vanishing phenomenon of unsupervised play among children — continues to sell internationally, 28 countries and counting. It won the Golden Sheaf for Best Science Documentary at the Yorkton Film Festival.</p>

        <p>More recent independents include Flying Solo, a film about the global movement towards living alone, and The Secret Life of Pigeons, premiered last fall to rave reviews. Our first natural history film for The Nature of Things, it’s a wry tale about the fascinating lives of these much maligned and often overlooked city creatures.

        Subsequent projects include Canadian Canvas, a series of short films narrated by Donald Sutherland for the Vancouver Olympic Games. And Sunday Night, a verite exploration of ennui in the 21st century office.

        As gun-for-hire, Scott has directed dozens of hours of factual programming, including CBC’s Age of Anxiety, which picked up Best Social Documentary honours at Banff. Other credits include William Shatner’s Weird or What, Urban Legends, Greatest Ever, Underworld and Who Do You Think You Are? He wrote and directed the Handel Productions film Double Identity: The Counterfeit Lives of Celebrity Lookalikes for CTV, Friendly Fire—a YAP Films production for CBC; Outbreak, a one-hour on the origin of infectious diseases; Casino Diaries, a Discovery US series on Las Vegas culture and Obesity: The Deadly Epidemic, for National Geographic, TLC and Granada.</p>
